    @01) Consider the problem of predicting y from x is R.
    @02) The leftmost figure below shows the result of fitting a y = theta[0] + theta[1]x to a dataset.
    @03) The data doesn't really lie on straight line => the fit is not very good.

    @07) Instead, if we had added an extra feature x^2, & fit y = theta[0] + theta[1]x + theta[2]x^2.
